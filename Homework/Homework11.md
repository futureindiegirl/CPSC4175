1. Stepwise refinement is where you make the big decisions now and leave the smaller ones for later. For example, if you were builting a house, you would decide how many rooms there would be first, but you would leave something like what color the wallpaper will be for later.
2. The topdown, stepwise refinement paradigm involves doing the major design aspects at the beginning. Later on, if there is a fault it would be difficult to go back and correct it while in OOAD it is much easier.
3. This article is about using stepwise refinement. Many people think they can just learn a language and they will be able to solve a problem. He states that a program should start as a set of refinment steps. A task should be broken into sub tasks and the description should be refined until it is understood. You should also investigate how the data is communicated between different subtasks. He also talks about how you should be mindful of your design. You must be able to look at your design clearly and potentially reject it.
4. In the book, the example is a company wanting to computerize its billing system. It looks at the benefits which are 80 employees can be replaced, and money flow can be improved because the bills can be sent out every month. The costs include hardware and software, setting up a data processing department, and the cost of explaining the system to customers.
